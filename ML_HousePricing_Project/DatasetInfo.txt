This dataset is a snapshot from October 2022 of all 48 homes in a section of a neighborhood nearby a large university in 
Central Florida. All of the homes are single family homes featuring a garage, a driveway, and a fenced-in backyard. 
Data was gathered by hand (keyboard) via a collection of sites, including Zillow, Realtor, Redfin, Trulia, and Orange 
County Property Appraiser. All homes were built in the same year in the early 2000's and feature central air and all 
other utilities typical of contemporary suburban homes in the United States. The area is close to a university and a large 
portion of renters are college students and young professionals, as well as families and older adults.
