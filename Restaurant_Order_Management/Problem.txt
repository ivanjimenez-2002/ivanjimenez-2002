Situation: Restaurant Order Management System
You are tasked with developing a Restaurant Order Management System for a small local diner. The system should handle multiple customers' orders, compute the total cost, and track which orders have been completed.

Requirements:
The diner offers a fixed menu with the following items and prices:

Burger: $5.99
Fries: $2.99
Drink: $1.99
Salad: $4.99
Each customer can order multiple items, and the system should track each customerâ€™s order.

After an order is placed, the system should calculate the total bill for the customer.

The system should also allow the diner staff to mark orders as "completed."

Display a list of pending and completed orders.

Your Task:
Create a menu system that allows customers to place orders.
Track orders in a way that associates each customer with their respective order.
Calculate the total cost of each order.
Implement functionality to mark orders as completed.
Display all orders and their statuses (pending or completed).
Bonus Challenge:
Add a feature to allow customers to add a tip to their total bill.
Ensure that the system keeps track of completed orders separately from pending ones.
This situation will help you practice designing solutions, handling data, and building systems that involve multiple operations.
