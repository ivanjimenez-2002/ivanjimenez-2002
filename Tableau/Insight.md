# Aviation Delay Dashboard Insights

This project compares aviation delay times between two airlines: American Airlines (AA) and JetBlue (B6). The goal is to identify delay patterns by season, analyze the types of delays, and compare how these delays differ between carriers.
The dataset originates from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and includes data from 2023–2024 and up to July 2025. All flights in this dataset depart from Orlando International Airport (MCO).

Key Findings
- Seasonal Peaks:
June and July consistently showed peak delay times. Notably, July 2023 delays for JetBlue were about 84% higher than July 2024. JetBlue attributed this spike to FAA air traffic controller shortages during that period.
- Airline Comparison:
JetBlue consistently recorded more delay time than American Airlines. This suggests AA may be more reliable if avoiding delays is a priority. However, the gap has narrowed over time:
- 2023 → JetBlue delays were 13.6% higher than AA
- 2024 → JetBlue delays were 8% higher
- July 2025 → JetBlue delays were 5% higher
This trend may indicate improving performance for JetBlue.
- Types of Delays:
The dataset categorizes delays into:
- Carrier Delay
- Late Aircraft Arrival
- National Aviation System Delay
- Security Delay
- Weather Delay
- Among these, Late Aircraft Arrival was the dominant cause. This raises questions such as:
- Was the pilot flying slower than expected?
- Did the flight experience long taxi times?
- Did issues arise at the originating airport?
The dataset does not provide enough detail to confirm these assumptions.
- July 2025 Trends:
Delay times in July 2025 were already 6% higher than July 2024 for both airlines. MCO reported a higher volume of tourists compared to previous years, likely influenced by the opening of Epic Universe at Universal Orlando Resort.
